#Twitter App

My first attempt at creating functional Twitter apps guided and inspired by the following tutorial;   [Build Your First Twitter App Using PHP in 8 Easy Steps](https://iag.me/socialmedia/build-your-first-twitter-app-using-php-in-8-easy-steps/)

These are coding exercises I completed while I was teaching myself how to integrate PHP script with the Twitter API. These are very simple  and basic PHP scripts.

##There are two scripts available

* **timeline.php** - a php script that obtains the most recent 100 tweets of the user's home timeline and displays them in text format.
* **favorator.php** - a php script that favorites the 10 most recent tweets in the user's home timeline. 

###Requirements:
+ PHP 5.4
+ Simple PHP Wrapper for Twitter API v1.1 calls. The Simple PHP Wrapper can be found in the [twitter-api-php repository](https://github.com/J7mbo/twitter-api-php) repository. The TwitterAPIExchange.php file must be placed in the same directory as the scripts.
+ A Twitter App. You can create a Twitter app at the [Twitter Developers website](https://dev.twitter.com). This will provide the necessary keys for these scripts to function and interface with the Twitter API.

You **MUST** have PHP 5.4 installed and configured properly for these scripts to function. If you are not familiar with PHP or how to get it working on your computer I recommend you start here; http://php.net/manual/en/tutorial.requirements.php
